search_tips: |
  <b>Search</b>
  ‚Ä¢ You can change search sorting by adding <code>/s</code><I>p</i> before the search query, where <i>p</i> - means by <b>p</b>opular or <i>n</i> - by <b>n</b>ew, for example: <code>/sp sex toys</code>
  ‚Ä¢ You can specify page number by adding <code>/p</code>[<i>n</i>] before the search query, where <i>n</i> - page number, for example: <code>/p5 sex toys</code>
  ‚Ä¢ You can search for multiple terms at the same time, and this will return only galleries that contain both terms. For example, <code>anal tanlines</code> finds all galleries that contain both anal and tanlines.
  ‚Ä¢ You can exclude terms by prefixing them with <code>-</code>. For example, anal tanlines -yaoi matches all galleries matching anal and tanlines but not yaoi.
  ‚Ä¢ Exact searches can be performed by wrapping terms in double quotes. For example, <code>"big breasts"</code> only matches galleries with <i>"big breasts"</i> somewhere in the title or in tags.
  ‚Ä¢ These can be combined with tag namespaces for finer control over the query: <code>parodies:railgun -tag:"big breast"</code>.
  ‚Ä¢ You can search for galleries with a specific number of pages with pages:20, or with a page range: <code>pages:&gt;20 pages:&lt;=30.</code>
  ‚Ä¢ You can search for galleries uploaded within some timeframe with <code>uploaded:20d</code>. Valid units are h, d, w, m, y.
  ‚Ä¢ You can use ranges as well: <code>uploaded:>20d uploaded:&lt;30d.</code>
